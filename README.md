## Introduction

This is the KUN Visual Novel navigation page, designed to index KUN Visual Novel and all its subsites, preventing loss of connection due to domain changes.

It is developed using `SolidStart`, providing incredibly fast performance.

The address for this navigation page is **nav.kungal.org**. We recommend bookmarking it to avoid losing contact.
